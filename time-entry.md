# Time Entry

We use [https://support.toggl.com](Toggl) for time tracking.

All time needs to be billed to a project. This helps me understand where employees are spending time and identifying opportunities for improvement and also helps me invoice clients (this is how we all get paid)

Client time goes to a client project and will be charged to that client. What you enter in as the description may show up on an invoice so try and make it something anyone can understand. If you are having trouble remembering what you did, Github commits can help understanding how long a task took and what you did. Calendar appointments can also help.

For non-client time - there is a Vexti project. Use this project for internal meetings, training, etc.

Driving - if you are arriving to or leaving a worksite for a meeting in the Lansing area once per day I don’t expect to pay for drive time. However if there are more meetings throughout the day with gaps (like a 9AM to 10AM meeting in East Lansing followed by a 10:30 - 11:30 meeting in downtown Lansing) I’d expect you to report time for 9AM to 11:30AM. Put the 30 minute gap from 10AM to 10:30 as Vexti Internal - Driving.

If you need to be at a meeting outside of the Lansing area, like Grand Rapids or Detroit put it into Toggl as something like 'meeting with client x + drive time' or 'onsite work + drive time'. If you also drive your own vehicle I expect to reiumburse you for mileage at the [IRS standard rate](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates).

Toggl has a website and a mobile app. It also has a timer. Feel free to record time how it works best for you. Client bills and salaries will be paid in ¼ increments rounding up.

If you don't know what project to bill the time to email your project manager.
